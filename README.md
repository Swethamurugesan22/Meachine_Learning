Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

In this article, we will learn to predict the survival chances of the Titanic passengers using the given information about their sex, age, etc.
As this is a classification task we will be using random forest.

There will be three main steps in this experiment:

            1) Feature Engineering
            2) Imputation
            3) Training and Prediction
